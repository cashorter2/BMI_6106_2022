# Introduction to Probability and Statistics - Spring 2022

### BMI 6106

### Instructors

•	Edgar Javier Hernandez, Ph.D.: edgarjavi@gmail.com

### Prerequisite
BMI Introduction to Programming (Python)

### Course Description

This course offers an introduction to an extensive array of methods for mathematical data analysis with emphasis on three major topics (probability analysis, statistical inference, and the basic concepts of statistical pattern recognition through machine learning), with a clear emphasis in the biomedical field. In here we will cover basic probability concepts such as recognizing the importance of the analysis of random events in real life applications, using probabilities axioms and rules. This course will present descriptive and inferential data methods for predictive analysis on samples and populations.  This introductory course lays the foundation for more advance classes offered at the Biomedical Informatics Department. As an additional component of this class will be the extensive use of the statistical software R which is one of the most used statistical packages in most fields.

### Learning Objectives:
1.	* By the end of this course, you will understand basic probability concepts, use probability rules, distinguish between discrete and continuous variables and the methods for their analysis, and solve problems related to random events.
2.	* By the end of the course, you will be able to describe the main methods for data exploration and analysis. You will use descriptive statistics to understand the nature of your data, and you will use hypothesis testing to predict the behavior of variables from samples and populations. 
3.	* By the end of the course, you will understand the concepts of machine learning and pattern recognition, such as cluster recognition, data classification, dimensionality reduction, and temporal patterns.
4.	* By the end of the course, you will have experience with of the most widely use statistical software in the sciences, R. You will be able to use many of the statistical and graphical packages available for this software.
